  (* [make_stream should_sync] streams [t] until it has run through all of them. 
   * Note that it remembers the last offset and continues from there assuming
   * the [Variable_store] passed to [Make] is persistent.
   * 
   * JW does three things that complicate this process:
   *
   *   1) Original media files are unavailable by default, requiring a 
   *      "passthrough" conversion to be added, which is not an instant process.
   *      @see http://qa.jwplayer.com/~abussey/demos/general/access-originals.html
   * 
   *   2) The passthrough conversion counts against space usage.
   *
   *   3) Conversions of unpublished ("expired") media are inaccessible. 
   *
   * This means we need to prepare most media before returning it and then undo
   * any changes that we made.
