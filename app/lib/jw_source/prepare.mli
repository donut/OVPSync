(** Why a video is considered prepared *)
type prepared = 
  | Has_non_ready_status
    (** The video has a non-ready status. This typically means that the file
        is still being transcoded at the source. It can also mean that that
        process has failed. In any case, we can still sync what we know about
        it now and sync the file details at a later pass. *)
  | Source_is_URL
    (** The file associated with this video is not hosted by the source, but
        at the specified source URL. We don't need to do prep in order to 
        sync. *)
  | Publish_timed_out
    (** Waiting on the video to publish at JW took too long so we're returning
        it as is and without video or thumbnail as neither are accessible of an
        unpublished video. *)
  | Passthrough_timed_out
    (** Waiting on the passthrough conversion to be processed at JW took too 
        long. The next largest (by dimensions) conversion that exists will
        be used in the passthrough's place, if one exists. *)
  | Passthrough_error
    (** An error was returned when testing the passthrough URL. There are some
        outstanding support cases with JW (#00094413, #00085845) related to
        this. The next largest (by dimensions) conversion that exists will be 
        used in the passthrough's place, if one exists. *)
  | Published_with_passthrough
    (** The video is published and has a passthrough conversion. A passthrough
        conversion is a way to access the original video file on JW's servers.
        To access that passthrough, the video must be published. *)


(** The preparation status of a video passted to {!video}. *)
type status =
  | No_need_to_sync
    (** The passed [should_sync] function determined there was no need to sync
        this video. *)
  | Missing
    (** No longer exists at JW. Likely was deleted in the time between getting
        the set of videos and checking on this one. *)
  | Processing
    (** Waiting on external processing before being able to sync this video. *)
  | Prepared of t * prepared
    (** Video is prepared. [t] is the prepared version and [prepared] is why it
        is considered ready for sync. *)


(** Configuration to pass to the {!Make} functor. *)
module type Config = sig
  val backup_expires_field : string
  (** In case a video's [expires_date] field is changed in preparation for sync,
      the old value is saved to this custom field of the video on JW. This field
      only serves as a backup in case the records his app keeps are lost. *)
